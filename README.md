## Iterate, quickly.

HuntTools (ht) is a CLI designed to help you perform repetitive operations easily.  
The expected input type is always a newline separated file and the default output type will return the same.   
Using this, you should spend less time trying to remember how to write a loop in bash and more time actually hunting

### Quick Download
<!-- This should point to the latest binary -->
#### Linux

Run the following and you should be good to go! 

```bash
wget -O ht https://github.com/rreichel3/hunttools/releases/download/0.1beta/linux_ht && chmod +x ./ht && ./ht
```

#### MacOS

Run the following and you should be good to go! 

```bash
wget -O ht https://github.com/rreichel3/hunttools/releases/download/0.1beta/mac_ht && chmod +x ./ht && ./ht
```

#### Windows
_Note: This is untested_
```bash
wget -O ht https://github.com/rreichel3/hunttools/releases/download/0.1beta/mac_ht 
```



### How to Use
The input expected is always a newline file. For example, the `ht ping -i infile.txt` command expects `infile.txt` to contain something like:
```
rj3.me
test.rj3.me
127.0.0.1
```
The default output will simply write the lines that are "positive" or in this case, responding to ping.  If you want more information on each one check out the `--verbose` flag.  

This enables us to easily chain commands together, writing the output of the ping to a file then running a subsequent command to get all of the hostnames.
